# Operating-System-Algorithms
Implementation of different algorithms used in operating systems.

Different algorithms that include:

#### 1.Job Scheduling Algorithms:
  - First Come Fist Serve
  - Priority 
  - Round Robin
  - Shortest Job First (SJF - preemptive)
  - Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
  
#### 2.Page Replacement Algorithms:
  - First In First Out (FIFO)
  - Least Frequently Used (LFU)
  - Most Frequently Used (MFU)
  - Least Recently Used (LRU)
  - Optimal 
  - Second Chance
  
#### 3.Memory Allocation Algorithms:
  - Best Fit
  - Worst Fit
  - Fist Fit
  

  
 I implemented these during my 4th semester of undergrad. All of them are in C language.
 There is also a 'master' file in the 'Memory Allocation Algorithms' and 'Page Replacement Algorithms' directory wherein all the algorithms are combined into one. Have fun learning!
